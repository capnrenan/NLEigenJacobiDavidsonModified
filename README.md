# NLEigenJacobiDavidsonModified
Routine to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue problem for real symmetric eigenproblem using the generalzied Jacobi-Davidson algorithm as proposed by [Dumont(2007)](https://doi.org/10.1002/nme.1997). 

It is used the C++ linear algebra library, [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen), and the C++ logging library, [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog).
