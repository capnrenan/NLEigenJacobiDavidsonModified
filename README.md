# NLEigenJacobiDavidsonModified
Routine to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue problem for real symmetric eigenproblem using the generalzied Jacobi-Davidson algorithm as proposed by Dumont(2007). 

It is used the C++ linear algebra, [Eigen][https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen], and the C++ logging libray, [spdlog][https://github.com/gabime/spdlog].
